# WiresharkVisualization
# This project is about taking wireshark pcap data and presenting it on a map to easily see the source and destination of a packet.
# First, data was collected using wireshark and saved as a pcap file. Then, using python the data was processed and output into the terminal 
# as kml text. After copying the output from the terminal, I used Notepad++ to convert the text to a kml file. The kml file was then uploaded using
# Google MyMaps to visually show the source and destination of the packets.

# The next step for this application would be to export the kml text directly to a text file instead of the terminal.

# Tools Used: Wireshark, Python, Notepad++, Google Maps
